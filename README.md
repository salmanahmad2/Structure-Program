# Structure-Program
Program that declares a structure to store price, author name and pages of a book. It defines two
structure variables and inputs values. It passes these variables to a function. The function returns the
variable with more price. The main() function will finally displays the values of returned structure
variable.

## How it Works
### Step 1
First of all a structure is defined named as book.

### Step 2
In the main function, the program will get values from the user and then a function will be called.

### Step 3
The function will then compare the price of the books.


### Step 4
The called function will then return the price of the most priced book, and the main function will display its details.
